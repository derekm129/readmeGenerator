# Professional README Generator

## Description
-This application is designed to streamline the creation of professional README files based on user input. 
Developed using JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer version 8.2.4, this application simplifies the process of creating README files. 
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in structuring JavaScript projects with multiple files, as well as mastering the usage of Node.js and Inquirer.

## Installation
- Ensure you have Node.js and Inquirer version 8.2.4 installed to utilize this application.
  
## Usage
- To begin using the application, clone the repository and navigate to the index.js file. Run 'node index.js' in your terminal to launch the program. Follow the prompted questions to input the necessary information and generate a professional README file. The generated file will be located in the 'dist' folder.
